# React Authentication

React frontend application focusing on authentication best practices. This is a continuous work in progress.

## Project Structure

The project structure follows a typical React application structure, with the following main components:

index.js: The main entry point for the application.
context: Contains the authentication context and provider.
App.js: The main component of the application.
pages: Contains different pages/components used in the application.
components: Contains reusable components.
data: Contains data files used in the application.

## Installation

Clone the repository:

git clone <repository_url>
Change to the project directory:

cd react-auth
Install the dependencies:

npm install
Start the development server:

npm run dev
This command runs the application using Vite, a fast development server.

## Dependencies

The project uses the following dependencies:

@chakra-ui/react: UI component library for React.
@emotion/react and @emotion/styled: Libraries for styling components with CSS-in-JS using Emotion.
@fortawesome/fontawesome-svg-core, @fortawesome/free-solid-svg-icons, and @fortawesome/react-fontawesome: Libraries for using FontAwesome icons.
axios: Promise-based HTTP client for making API requests.
framer-motion: Library for creating animations in React.
react and react-dom: Core libraries for building React applications.
react-router-dom: Library for handling routing in React applications.

## Usage

The frontend application provides routes for different pages/components and includes authentication-related functionality. The main entry file index.js sets up the React application and renders the App component.

The application supports the following routes:

/login: Login page.
/register: Register page.
/linkpage: Link page.
/unauthorized: Unauthorized access page.
/: Home page (protected route, accessible only to users with the User role).
/editor: Editor page (protected route, accessible only to users with the Editor role).
/admin: Admin page (protected route, accessible only to users with the Admin role).
/lounge: Lounge page (protected route, accessible to users with the Editor or Admin role).
/\*: 404 page.
Feel free to explore and modify the routes, components, and configurations to suit your authentication requirements.
